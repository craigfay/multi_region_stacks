1. **Cache-Control:** The most important HTTP header for controlling cache behavior. It can have several directives:
   - `no-store`: The cache must not store a copy of the representation under any conditions.
   - `no-cache`: The cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful validation on the origin server.
   - `private`: The response is intended for a single user and must not be stored by a shared cache.
   - `public`: The response may be stored by any cache.
   - `max-age=<seconds>`: Specifies the maximum amount of time a resource is considered fresh.
   - `s-maxage=<seconds>`: Like `max-age`, but it only applies to shared (e.g., proxy) caches.

2. **Pragma:** HTTP/1.0 header field, only includes `no-cache` directive similar to `Cache-Control: no-cache`.

3. **Expires:** This header contains the date/time after which the response is considered stale.

4. **ETag:** The ETag (entity tag) header field is used to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server.

5. **Last-Modified:** The Last-Modified header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the resource was last modified. It's often used with the `If-Modified-Since` header.

6. **If-Modified-Since:** Used with the Last-Modified header, the client sends a conditional request with the `If-Modified-Since` header containing the Last-Modified value for the cached version of the resource. If the resource has not been modified since that time, the server will respond with a `304 Not Modified` status.

7. **If-None-Match:** The `If-None-Match` header field makes the request conditional. It is used with the ETag header. The server compares the client's ETag (provided in the `If-None-Match` header) with the ETag for the current version of the resource. If they match (i.e., the resource has not changed), the server responds with a `304 Not Modified` status.

8. **Vary:** The `Vary` header field determines how the response might vary. It's used to guide caching of responses that are dependent on certain request headers. For example, if responses vary based on the `User-Agent` (the client software), then `Vary: User-Agent` will be included in the response, informing the cache that it must consider the `User-Agent` request header when trying to find a match for future requests.

9. **Age:** The `Age` header contains the time in seconds the object has been in a proxy cache.
